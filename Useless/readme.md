An implementation of the 3D reversible cellular automata developed by Ed Fredkin and Daniel B. Miller in their 2005 paper,
<a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1062261.1062271">Two State, Reversible, Universal Cellular Automata In Three Dimensions</a>. 
A preprint is available <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/nlin/0501022">here</a>.

The new paper, which makes numerous references to the website running this software, is up on
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.2060">the arXiv</a>.




It's running live (as of March, 2012) <a href="http://bbx.logqr.com/">here</a>.

More info can be found in the <a href="http://bbx.logqr.com/faq.html">faq.</a>

All of the code is right now in index.html.
